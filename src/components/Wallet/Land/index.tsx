          Metaverse means a platform or 3D space where people appear as their
          avatars (an avatar is your character, which can be an animal, human,
          or other different appearances in the Metaverse platform and the game
          space). This presence can be for social connections, purchasing from
          the available markets, or attending meetings or concerts on a
          platform. Consider having multiple avatars in the street where you own
          land, which is the same as having a shop on a busy street. The Smart
          World Metaverse has been based on some essential elements such as
          entertainment, communications, user interaction, and play to earn. The
          smart world Metaverse is inspired by the great "Minecraft" game, which
          includes 10 thousand unique Metaverse land pieces. Each land piece
          will be sold at a fixed price on the initial auction. Afterward, the
          rest of the land prices will be different depending on their features.
          The users who buy the lands beforehand will be the most precious ones
          with low prices. You will be entitled to 25% of the sold land cost if
          you introduce a new buyer. The lands include some attributes like
          seasons, the construction sector, and promotional banners. They may
          also be gold, diamond, or coal mines or have timber export potential.
          The landlords can sell their assets (coal, gold, wood) to those who
          need construction on their land. Some lands have a promotional banner.
          Their holders can either propagandize their own business, rent out the
          banner or their plot to applicants, and BNB charges the rent fee.
          After 25 percent of the land is sold, the selling process will be
          started in the Smart World exclusive marketplace and the Pancake Swap
          NFT market. The Smart World Metaverse game is based on the land userâ€™s
          construction for purposes such as presentation services offices,
          publicity, and selling products agencies. Growing the construction on
          the land will increase the Smart World visitors, so naturally, the
          land price will be increased a thousandfold.
